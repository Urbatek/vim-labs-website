## Welcome to the new Vim Labs website!

We needed a place to call home -- some space on the web where we could put a stake in the ground to communicate our vision, organize, and document the process. This is the spot!

## So, what is Vim Labs all about?

The Vim Labs project was founded by me, [Ryan Bell](https://twitter.com/iRyanBell). I've spent the last decade in the freelance design & development space in Las Vegas, NV, working with artists, musicians, and various corporate entities. It's been a fantastic way for me to stay nimble, explore many disciplines, and wear many hats.

Now, looking toward the horizon for 2020, I'd like to tackle bigger, bolder challenges, and transition most of my focus from client projects toward **passion projects.**

## New beginnings

A community platform for ephemeral conversations, called Convvo, will be the application out of the new design laboratory.

More to come!
