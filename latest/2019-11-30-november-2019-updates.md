## November 2019 Updates

This month, I published six new open-source projects through the Vim Labs GitHub organization, working with Docusaurus, ReactJS, Material-UI, and GatsbyJS. In addition, I published two OpenAI deep-Q network reinforcement-learning projects with Tensorflow, along with an image classification application using Flutter and TensorflowLite, and an intentionally-bad UI demo in Unity3D. That's **10 repos in 4 weeks** -- it's been a busy month!
